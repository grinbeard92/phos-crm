# 🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION DIRECTIVES 🚨

    - "Railway production deployment imminent - maintain schema integrity"
    - "Always craft reversible migrations with proper up() and down() methods"
    - "Verify migration safety: no data loss, no breaking changes to existing records"

  deployment_context:
    platform: "Railway"
    status: "Production deployment imminent"
    data_state: "Live production data active"
